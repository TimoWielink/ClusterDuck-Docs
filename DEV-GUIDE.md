# ClusterDuck Developer's Guide

## Introduction

The ClusterDuck Protocol (CDP) was created by Project OWL to be an easy to use mobile mesh network 
that can be accessed by people without the need to have specific hardware or pre-downloaded software (such as a mobile app). 
Since its creation, the vision for the ClusterDuck Protocol has grown beyond only servicing people in need after a hurricane 
towards additional use cases around earthquakes, wildfires, cellular congestion (large events), sensor networks, and more. i
Project OWL open-sourced this project so that the ClusterDuck Protocol could reach the communities that need it as fast as possible 
and continue to explore new directions.
